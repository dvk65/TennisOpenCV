This is a Unity based tennis game made using OpenCV and C#. <br>
The player controls, racket controls and triggers in the scene are all made using C#. <br>
The movement of the player however can be controlled using any blue object. This control is achieved using UDP sockets and OpenCV. <br>
The main principle this project explores is gesture recognition. <br>
A way of contributing to this project would be to add and keep track of scores based on the rules of tennis.
